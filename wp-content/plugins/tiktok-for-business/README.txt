This build seamlessly connects your application to TikTok to enable marketing and sales opportunities. 

== Description ==

The official integration with TikTok makes it easy to put your business in front of billions of highly engaged consumers, helping you achieve your marketing objectives. These users aren't just browsing; they're buying, as evidenced by the popular hashtag #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt. And they could become your next customers.

With the official integration on TikTok, you can seamlessly set up and get started with a TikTok For Business Account, TikTok Ads Manager, and TikTok Business Center in just a few clicks. You can also:

-   Install a new TikTok Pixel (or connect an existing one) and enable Events API
-   Run advertising campaigns, encouraging users from the highly engaged TikTok community to take meaningful actions and finding new customers which can help you gain qualified leads for your business.
-   In selected markets (including UK and US), the integration also allows merchants to onboard to TikTok Shop to showcase and sell directly on the platform through in-feed videos, LIVEs, and the new Store Page.

Want to do more and also run Conversion campaigns to increase your sales? Then, download the official integration directly from [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/products/tiktok-for-woocommerce/) to unlock additional features such as syncing your store catalog and creating videos with your product images in seconds to boost your sales.

Experience the potential of TikTok for your business with the official TikTok integration. Your global customer base is just a click away!

== TIKTOK INTEGRATION FEATURES ==

=== SAFE AND RELIABLE DATA CONNECTION ===

Leverage the one-click install (no developer needed) to utilize both Pixel and Events API on TikTok

1.  **Enable Dual Data Connections:** Through the TikTok Pixel and Events API, gain deep insights and a comprehensive view of your campaign performance by enabling browser and server-side connection of a Wordpress site or WooCommerce store. Utilize this information to make informed decisions of your marketing and business strategies on TikTok.
2.  **Implement Full-Funnel Event Measurement with Automatic Updates:** Measure events throughout the customer journey on your website. Understand the full impact of your ads, optimize campaigns, and find and retarget potential customers.
3.  **Expand Your Reach with Advanced Matching:** Enabling Advanced Matching allows for more refined targeting and optimization, and has shown to have positive impact on campaign performance.

Advertisers with an existing TikTok Pixel can connect that to the TikTok integration. We recommend leveraging the new pixel created and installed via the official Wordpress integration with TikTok for a more seamless setup and event deduplication. Should you prefer to leverage an existing custom setup, we kindly remind developer teams to be mindful of deduplication work that may be required for accurate reporting. Further details on deduplication can be found on our [TikTok Business Help Center](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/event-deduplication?lang=en).
