== WHAT IS INCLUDED IN OUR RETURN REFUND AND EXCHANGE FOR WOOCOMMERCE PLUGIN ==

**1) Initiate Return, Exchange & Cancellation For A Specific Period**: Our WordPress RMA plugin enables the admin to set a specific time frame for all the refund, exchange and cancellation requests. During this defined period, customers will have access to these respective request options on the website, while outside this timeframe, they will no longer be visible.

**2) Dedicated WooCommerce refund system**: With our Return Refund and Exchange plugin, merchants can create a dedicated refund system, which offers a money-back guarantee, and where they can build an email template to send to the customers who ask for a refund. Merchants can add the name, email, email header, and footer for their email template

**3) Predefined Refund Reason**: Merchants can add multiple reasons for a product refund. Customers can select any of these reasons while asking for a refund with the help of Warranties & Returns For WooCommerce.

**4) Mail Notification For Refund**: Merchants can notify the customers of different scenarios for the product refund. They can create different emails if a refund request is generated, approved, or canceled. Merchants can add a different subject line and content for every scenario. They can also use Shortcodes to add elements to the email content.

**5) Efficient Tax Handling**: By incorporating our WooCommerce Refund and Exchange with RMA, merchants can handle the tax on the refund products easily. They can simply enable or disable the tax calculation on the refund products by going to the plugin settings and enabling the Enable Tax option.

**6) Stock Management**: Our WooCommerce Refund Plugin provides a feature to manage stock. Merchants need to enable this feature from the plugin settings. Once you enable this feature, the product stock will be increased whenever a refund request is accepted.

For example, if you select Completed, and Failed order statuses, you'll allow your customers to generate a refund request if their order is completed, or failed.
